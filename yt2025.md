   * *Why:* Core of the name, implies weight, permanence, darkness. Highly searched term (gaming, sci-fi, mystery).
2. **Polygon** (Direct & Techy)
   * *Why:* Core of the name, geometric, digital, gaming/metaverse relevance. Constantly searched term.
3. **PolyNexus** (Futuristic Blend)
   * *Why:* Combines "Poly" with "Nexus" (connection point, hub - highly searched tech/AI/metaverse term). Sounds like a tech platform or network.
4. **NeoLith** (Cyberpunk Edge)
   * *Why:* "Neo" (new, future, Matrix reference) + "Lith". Short, memorable, implies futuristic solidity/darkness. "Neo" is a perennial sci-fi favorite.
5. **Quantum Shard** (Sci-Fi Intrigue)
   * *Why:* "Quantum" (massive tech/AI search term) + "Shard" (fragment of monolith). Evokes advanced tech, mystery, and fits experimental sound. Visually striking.
6. **Void Nexus** (Dark & Atmospheric)
   * *Why:* "Void" (dark, atmospheric, space - popular in gaming/sci-fi) + "Nexus". Perfect for dark ambient/industrial. Both words are strong search magnets individually.
7. **Gridlock** (Industrial Rhythm)
   * *Why:* Imposes rigid structure, electronic pulse, urban/technological feel. Searched in gaming (traffic sims), tech, and music contexts. Short and punchy.
8. **Edge Form** (Abstract & Geometric)
   * *Why:* Directly references polygonal geometry ("edges", "forms"). Abstract, memorable, sounds like a design principle or AI concept.
9. **Static Core** (Raw & Textured)
   * *Why:* "Static" (noise, glitch, interference - relevant to industrial music) + "Core" (central, essential). Searched in tech troubleshooting and music genres. Evokes raw energy.
10. **Axiom** (Foundational & Authoritative)
    * *Why:* A self-evident truth or foundation. Implies the solidity of a monolith and the logic of polygons. Short, powerful, increasingly searched in tech/AI/philosophy contexts.

**Key Considerations for 2025 Relevance:**

* **Tech/AI Focus:** Terms like "Quantum," "Nexus," and "Axiom" leverage projected high search volume around AI advancements and the evolving metaverse.
* **Sci-Fi/Gaming Crossover:** "Monolith," "Void," "Polygon," "Gridlock" tap into enduring popularity of sci-fi and gaming content on YouTube.
* **Dark/Industrial Aesthetic:** "Void," "Static," "Shard," "Monolith" align with a heavier, atmospheric, or experimental musical style.
* **Conciseness & Memorability:** All options are 1-2 words, easy to recall, spell, and say.
* **Brand Alignment:** Each name connects back to the core elements of "Monolit Polygons" â€“ solidity, geometry, digital/future, potential darkness.

**Recommendation:** Prioritize **Monolith**, **Polygon**, or **PolyNexus** for the strongest direct name connection combined with high inherent search volume and future-tech relevance. **Void Nexus** or **Quantum Shard** are excellent choices if emphasizing a darker or more experimental sci-fi sound. **Gridlock** is ideal for a rhythmic, industrial-techno focus.

Develop a comprehensive HTML, JavaScript, and potentially a server-side component (e.g., Node.js) solution for automatically generating an EPG (Electronic Program Guide) in XML format. The system should fetch and process EPG data, then output an XML file suitable for hosting. The solution must support the following channels, extracting and formatting their program information: CT1HD, CT 2 HD, NOVA, PRIMA HD, AMC HD, AXN HD, CINEMAX HD, CINEMAX 2 HD, FILM+ HD, FILMBOX HD, HBO HD, HBO 2 HD, HBO 3 HD, NOVA CINEMA HD, CT 24 HD, CT 24 REPRIZA, ČT24 (1080P), CNN PRIMA, PRIMA ZOOM HD, CT SPORT HD, NOVA FUN HD, NOVA ACTION HD, NOVA GOLD HD, NOVA LADY HD, PRIMA COOL, PRIMA SHOW, PRIMA MAX HD, KRIMI HD, PRIMA KRIMI HD, and PRIMA LOVE HD. The generated XML should be well-formed and valid according to EPG standards, including correct channel identifiers, program titles, descriptions, start and end times, and any other relevant metadata. The system should be designed to be automated, fetching updated EPG data at regular intervals and regenerating the XML file. Consider error handling for data retrieval and processing. The final output should be an XML file ready for deployment on a web server.Develop a comprehensive HTML, JavaScript, and potentially a server-side component (e.g., Node.js) solution for automatically generating an EPG (Electronic Program Guide) in XML format.

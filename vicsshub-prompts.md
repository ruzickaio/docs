Design and develop a fully functional, self-hosted platform named VicssHub, serving as an alternative to GitHub.com. The platform should enable users to create, manage, and store code repositories with version control capabilities. Implement a robust user authentication and authorization system to secure user accounts and repository access. The core features must include user accounts, repository storage, and essential settings. The system should support the creation of public and private repositories, allowing users to control access. Implement features for forking, cloning, and pull requests. Include user profile settings, repository configuration options (e.g., description, visibility, collaborators), and notification preferences. The platform should be designed with scalability and security in mind, providing a user-friendly interface for code management and collaboration. Ensure the platform is built with modern web development best practices, including responsive design and efficient data handling. The platform should also include a search functionality to allow users to find repositories and users. The platform should also include a dashboard for users to view their repositories, activity, and notifications. based on design shadcn/ui (en/cz , dark/light)
